# IoTControl — Internet of Controllers

Software development initiative focused on **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **real-time monitoring**, and **smart control systems**. 
We build modern, scalable, and research-driven platforms that bridge **embedded hardware**, **control engineering**, and **cloud-native software**,
applying **process control**, **machine learning**, **embedded solutions**, **data network management**, and **analytics**.

🚀 Our mission is to make advanced control systems and IoT applications accessible to developers, researchers, and industry.
